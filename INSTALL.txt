To run our system:
1. Unzip
2. Run command: [make build]
3. Run command: [make match] to interact with the system

You can now create an account, fill out the survey, and get matches. 
The sign in feature is also implemented 

Note: the json file is currently empty, so the first time you sign up, you will not get any matches
